Product Name

Sam’s Hurricane Analyzer PWA

Product Summary

Sam’s Hurricane Analyzer PWA is a Progressive Web App designed to provide real-time, on-demand weather analysis focused on tropical storm developments in the Caribbean. The app supports offline access, ensuring users can view cached weather data during network interruptions. Users can initiate data refreshes for the latest weather information and receive valuable insights to inform travel plans in tropical regions.

1. Objectives

Primary Goal: Provide reliable, real-time weather analysis on tropical storm developments, supporting users with decision-making for travel in the Caribbean.

Secondary Goal: Enable offline access to cached weather data, allowing users to access recent weather information without connectivity.

Core Value Proposition: Equip users with a lightweight, mobile-friendly, and on-demand weather analysis tool, designed with explicit data fetching, offline support, and efficient caching.


2. Target Audience

Primary Users: Individuals planning travel in the Caribbean during hurricane season who need on-demand weather updates.

Secondary Users: Weather enthusiasts and researchers interested in tropical storm monitoring and real-time data analysis.

3. Features

Core Features

1. Real-Time Weather Data on User Request

Users can manually initiate data refreshes through a “Refresh Data” button, loading current weather conditions and forecasts.

The app will display the last update timestamp for reference.



2. Offline Access

Cached data allows users to view recent weather data when offline, with a clear “Offline” notification and timestamp of the last update.

An offline fallback page displays if the app can’t access the network at all.



3. Efficient Data Management and Caching

Temporary caching (10-15 minutes) prevents excessive data requests if users refresh frequently.

Cache storage is optimized, with maximum cache limits (e.g., 50MB) and automatic expiration for weather data every 6 hours.

Data storage in IndexedDB ensures smooth access to larger data files (e.g., NOAA forecasts) without reloading from the network.



4. Add-to-Home Screen Functionality

Users are prompted to install the PWA on their home screen after a few uses, highlighting benefits like offline access and quick loading.



5. Minimalist UI/UX Design

The interface provides a text-based, summary-focused display of weather data, organized by current conditions, forecasted conditions, and any warnings.

A simple, mobile-first layout with touch-friendly controls supports easy navigation and user interaction on all device types.

4. Non-Core Features

1. Progressive Enhancement for Advanced Browsers

Detects and enables service worker features, IndexedDB, and other advanced PWA functionalities on modern browsers while gracefully degrading for unsupported ones.



2. Regular Data Source Reviews

Monthly review of primary data sources (e.g., NOAA, NHC) to ensure reliability and accuracy.

Backup data sources are identified in case primary sources become unreliable.

5. Design and UX Requirements

Interface Requirements

Mobile-First Design: Prioritize mobile experience, with responsive layouts using Flexbox or Grid.

Simple Refresh Mechanism: Prominent “Refresh Data” button for easy, user-initiated data updates.

Timestamp Display: Display the last update time on the main screen.

Offline Indicators: Clearly show when the user is offline and provide a cached version of recent data.


Accessibility

Ensure large, touch-friendly buttons and text for easy interaction on mobile.

Adhere to WCAG 2.1 guidelines to ensure readability and accessibility for all users.

6. Technical Requirements

Frontend

Framework: JavaScript (React, Vue, or similar) for modular UI components and state management.

Service Worker: Handles caching, offline mode, and lifecycle events.

IndexedDB: Stores larger datasets for offline access.


API Integration

Data Sources:

NOAA 7-Day Graphical Tropical Weather Outlook

Mean Sea Level Pressure (MSLP) Anomaly Maps

500mb Geopotential Height & Anomaly Maps

850mb Vorticity Maps

200-850mb Wind Shear Maps

Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Maps

Local Jamaica weather observations and forecasts


API Security: API keys managed via serverless functions or environment variables.


Performance Optimization

Lazy Loading: Load heavy components only when required.

Media Optimization: Compress images and use WebP format to reduce loading time.

Resource Management: Batch updates and limit DOM nodes to reduce memory load.


Error Handling

Network Error Management: Retry logic with exponential backoff for API requests, and custom error messages if data can’t be retrieved.



---

7. Security Requirements

HTTPS Requirement: All connections must use HTTPS for data integrity and security.

API Key Management: Secure API keys using server-side calls or serverless functions.

Cache Management: Cache versioning ensures that old versions of the app don’t hold onto obsolete data.



---

8. Project Milestones

1. Phase 1: Core Development

Set up project structure, including service worker, IndexedDB, and initial caching mechanisms.

Implement API integrations with NOAA and other data sources.

Develop core UI/UX components with mobile-first responsiveness.



2. Phase 2: User Testing and Refinement

Conduct testing for offline mode, caching, and manual data refreshing.

Validate API performance and ensure caching strategies align with user needs.

Incorporate feedback to refine UI elements, loading times, and error handling.



3. Phase 3: Progressive Enhancement and Deployment

Add enhancements for advanced browsers.

Implement Add-to-Home Screen functionality and custom install prompt.

Finalize security and data management requirements before deployment.



4. Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance

Schedule regular data source reviews to maintain accuracy and reliability.

Monitor user feedback for potential improvements and address any reported issues.

9. Future Considerations

Additional Data Sources: Explore adding more granular weather data sources or regional models if user demand arises.

User Feedback Integration: If usage grows, consider adding features like a simple feedback form for users to report issues or request features.

Refinement of Offline Capabilities: Based on feedback, explore enhancements to offline functionality, such as additional data caching for frequent users.
