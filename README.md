# Sam's Hurricane Analyzer PWA

A PWA that provides analysis of current hurricane activities in the Caribbean.

This project turns a simple web app into an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) that works offline and can be added to your mobile or desktop device for quick access.

You can view and use the live app here: [Sam's Hurricane Analyzer PWA](https://samwell.github.io/hurricane-analyzer/).

## How to Use This PWA

This web app is designed to provide up-to-date information and analysis of hurricanes in the Caribbean. It includes features such as offline access and installation prompts, so you can stay informed even without an internet connection.

## Getting Started

      3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the app locally.



      Deploying to GitHub Pages
